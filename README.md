This project is intended to work as a comprehensive restaurant management system that'll allow business owners and staff to automate their in-house management systems. This could be used to convert businesses who don't have sophisticated management systems (some who may still be on paper) and introduce them to a tech-based system. The project implements ways to keep track of current stock, a history of all order transactions, donations, the menu, restocking, and even possible to track seating arragements. The database uses hash tables - using separate-chaining - to populate and organize dishes and linked-lists to hold all order transactions. The project uses object-oriented-programming to accomplish internal data management.

I would like to note that this was an assigned class project. The authors/creators of the assignment are Mary Buist and Kushi Sharma. Aside from folder and function structure, all implementation was done by me, Zahir Rivas.
